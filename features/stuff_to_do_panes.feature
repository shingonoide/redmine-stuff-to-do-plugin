Feature: Stuff to do panes
  As a user with stuff to work on
  I want to see a prioritized list of what to work on
  So I can work on the most important thing next

  Scenario: See a prioritized list of tasks and projects to do now
    Given there are 3 issues to do
    And there are 2 projects to do
    And I am logged in
    And I am on the stuff to do page

    Then I should see "What I'm doing now"
    And I should see a list of tasks called "doing-now"
    And I should see a row for 5 "doing-now" tasks
    And I should see the issue title in the row

  Scenario: See a prioritized list of recommended tasks
    Given there are 35 issues to do
    And there are 10 projects to do
    And I am logged in
    And I am on the stuff to do page
    Then I should see "What's recommended to do next"
    And I should see a list of tasks called "recommended"
    And I should see a row for 40 "recommended" tasks

  Scenario: See a list of all assigned tasks
    Given there are 30 issues assigned to me
    And there are 5 issues to do
    And there are 10 issues not assigned to me
    And I am logged in
    And I am on the stuff to do page
    Then I should see "What's available"
    And I should see a list of tasks called "available"
    And I should see a row for 30 "available" tasks
